# Learning Node.js

In this repository, I'm storing files that I created on my Node.js learning journey.
My main resource for that is Traverys Media Node.js Crash Course video on YouTube which is streamed on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4&t=3s

I will create a repository for Express.js and MongoDB as well. After all, I have a plan to create a full-fledged project to consolidate my knowledge on Node, Express and MongoDB, so stay tune :)
